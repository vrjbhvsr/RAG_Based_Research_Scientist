    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Before building the complete agent, I am first creating a **baseline LLM model** that can **summarize paragraphs** from research papers.  \n",
    "This step helps establish the core functionality (text understanding and summarization) that will later be integrated into the **Text Agent** component of the CellSense system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan\n",
    "1. Implement a simple LLM pipeline with:\n",
    "   - Model configuration  \n",
    "   - Prompt template  \n",
    "   - Output parser (for structured summaries)\n",
    "2. Test the model by summarizing random paragraphs from sample papers.\n",
    "3. Analyze the outputs and refine the prompt for clarity and accuracy.\n",
    "4. Once validated, extend the pipeline to include:\n",
    "   - Document Loaders  \n",
    "   - Text Splitters  \n",
    "   - Memory and Tools  \n",
    "   - Agent orchestration (in later stages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "A working summarization prototype that serves as the **foundation for the Text Agent**, capable of analyzing scientific text before integrating with other agents in CellSense.\n"

      "The paragraph discusses research in regenerative medicine focusing on electrical stimulation (ES) and how it influences tissues and cells. While the exact mechanisms of ES remain unclear, the study examines the effects of specific electrical parameters such as intensity, frequency, and duration. Human MG-63 osteoblasts were subjected to electrical stimulation for 10 minutes using a multi-channel system (IonOptix), employing alternating current (AC) electrical fields at voltages of 1 or 5 V and frequencies of 7.9 or 20 Hz. The researchers ensured that liquid-mediated effects were eliminated by analyzing the AC-stimulated culture medium, confirming no changes in pH, temperature, or oxygen content. However, a significant increase in H2O2 levels was noted at 5 V and 7.9 Hz within the first 30 minutes. The study found that pulsed electrical stimulation promoted attachment and initial adhesion of the osteoblasts, while also increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels, particularly at 20 Hz for both voltages. Enhanced Ca2+ mobilization was observed following an additional ATP trigger, contributing to understanding how electrical stimulation aids in bone tissue regeneration.\n",

The study uses a multi-channel system (IonOptix) to apply alternating current (AC) electrical fields at voltages of 1 or 5 V and frequencies of 7.9 or 20 Hz for 10 minutes. Parameters such as pH, temperature, and oxygen content of the culture medium were tested to rule out liquid-mediated effects, revealing no changes aside from a significant increase in H2O2 at 5 V and 7.9 Hz. The findings indicate that pulsed electrical stimulation improved attachment and initial adhesion of suspended osteoblasts, while intracellular Ca2+ levels rose significantly, peaking in cells stimulated at 20 Hz with both voltages.

      "page_content='A widespread research ﬁeld in regenerative medicine is electrical stimulation (ES), and its impact on tissue and cells, such as bone [1]. In 1957 the piezoelectric properties of bone were described [2]. As the bone healing process takes place under the mechanical strain of the bone [3], an electric ﬁeld is generated in the bone in vitro and in vivo [4]. Externally applied electric ﬁelds were shown to contribute to bone deposition and osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [5]. The living cell has a membrane potential that indicates the electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space, which is generated by the transport of ions through ion channels and ion transporters [6]. The membrane potential is always negative because of the higher negative ion concentration inside the cell [7,8]. Primary osteoblasts revealed a membrane potential of −60 mV [9], MG- 63 osteoblasts demonstrated a negatively charged cell surface of −15.6 mV [10]. Due to the appearance of ions and polar or charged molecules, cells can build up electrical ﬁelds or can respond to them [11,12]. If injuries appear on the bone, a wound potential, which should lead precursor cells to differentiation, will be generated [13].

      "page_content='therapy is through electrical stimulation to accelerate bone healing. In some publications, it is described that ES can manipulate different cell processes, for example, cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and differentiation [8,14]. Widespread methods of the ES for bone tissue are invasive methods like direct contact stimulation [14], in vitro, the electrically conductive electrodes are placed directly in the culture medium. The applied current streams from the anode to the cathode [15]. The modiﬁcation of the cell membrane potential through ES can activate different intracellular pathways. External electrical ﬁelds can generate an intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) ﬂow and consequently activate different pathways [16], such as wnt [17]. Ca2+ dynamics were identiﬁed as a sensitive parameter for cell physiological processes. Furthermore, the ES can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can control different cellular processes like proliferation and modulated signaling pathways [18,19]. When the equilibrium is destroyed, and the concentration of ROS is relatively high, cells suffer under oxidative stress. Moreover, Ca2+ signaling was shown to contribute to ROS generation through calmodulin [20], as well as ROS contributing to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations by altering calcium channels [21].' metadata={'source': '/home/vraj/Desktop/CellSense/X20251016-CellSense-VB/Documents/cells-11-02650-v2.pdf', 'detection_class_prob': 0.9451494812965393, 'is_extracted': 'true', 'coordinates': {'points': ((np.float64(461.375), np.float64(269.4460144042969)), (np.float64(461.375), np.float64(822.0179255555554)), (np.float64(1559.515869140625), np.float64(822.0179255555554)), (np.float64(1559.515869140625), np.float64(269.4460144042969))), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 1654, 'layout_height': 2339}, 'links': [{'text': '8', 'url': 'cite.B8-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 248}, {'text': '14', 'url': 'cite.B14-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 250}, {'text': '14', 'url': 'cite.B14-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 354}, {'text': '15', 'url': 'cite.B15-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 510}, {'text': '16', 'url': 'cite.B16-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 745}, {'text': '17', 'url': 'cite.B17-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 763}, {'text': '18', 'url': 'cite.B18-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 1039}, {'text': '19', 'url': 'cite.B19-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 1042}, {'text': '20', 'url': 'cite.B20-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 1255}, {'text': '21', 'url': 'cite.B21-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 1365}], 'last_modified': '2025-11-01T08:41:48', 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'languages': ['eng'], 'page_number': 2, 'file_directory': '/home/vraj/Desktop/CellSense/X20251016-CellSense-VB/Documents', 'filename': 'cells-11-02650-v2.pdf', 'parent_id': '5c72fa6a292e875d7cf7227febce387c', 'category': 'NarrativeText', 'element_id': '98f6f82afafc5ee3a321c5576b152288'}\n",
      "page_content='It was described that the electric ﬁeld could modulate cell functions in order to accelerate wound healing and bone regeneration [5,12,14]. In contrast to previous studies, we are focusing on the inﬂuence of a short alternating current (AC)-stimulation time on settling cells via a commercial device (IonOptix) with the following parameters: rectangular waveform, voltages of ±1 or ±5 V, frequency of 7.9 Hz with pulse duration of 10 ms, or 20 Hz with pulse duration of 3.6 ms. In vitro, cell processes such as intracellular Ca2+ level and mobilization, adhesion, and morphology of human osteoblasts within 24 h were studied to understand the effect of ES on osteoblast behavior. In addition, we wanted to shed light on the question of whether ES affects the cells via liquids, i.e., AC-pre-conditioned medium. For these cell experiments, solely the cell culture medium was stimulated in the IonOptix chamber and analyzed for pH, temperature, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide content.' metadata={'source': '/home/vraj/Desktop/CellSense/X20251016-CellSense-VB/Documents/cells-11-02650-v2.pdf', 'detection_class_prob': 0.9492477178573608, 'is_extracted': 'true', 'coordinates': {'points': ((np.float64(461.04166666666663), np.float64(828.5343017578125)), (np.float64(461.04166666666663), np.float64(1205.5790366666668)), (np.float64(1563.43310546875), np.float64(1205.5790366666668)), (np.float64(1563.43310546875), np.float64(828.5343017578125))), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 1654, 'layout_height': 2339}, 'links': [{'text': '5', 'url': 'cite.B5-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 130}, {'text': '12', 'url': 'cite.B12-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 132}, {'text': '14', 'url': 'cite.B14-cells-1864162', 'start_index': 135}], 'last_modified': '2025-11-01T08:41:48', 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'languages': ['eng'], 'page_number': 2, 'file_directory': '/home/vraj/Desktop/CellSense/X20251016-CellSense-VB/Documents', 'filename': 'cells-11-02650-v2.pdf', 'parent_id': '5c72fa6a292e875d7cf7227febce387c', 'category': 'NarrativeText', 'element_id': '5a451a91fa6ad5d13afe4f6addf0a533'}\n",

      "page_content='The stimulation chamber C-Pace EM 100 is a multi-channel stimulator that enables the alternating current (AC)-stimulation of cells in an incubator. The electrodes are designed for a 12-well plate (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), and reach down to the bottom of the wells. This way, all cells can be electrically stimulated. The electrodes consist of carbon in the graphite modiﬁcation and are shaped in a plate format (capacitor). The advantages of graphite are its excellent electrical conductivity and the high resistance against corrosion. The protein adsorption on the surface is problematic as it affects the electrical ﬁeld´s homogeneity. Therefore, a regular cleaning after use is necessary [22]. The electrodes can be sterilized by treatment with ethanol and ultraviolet light (UV). The space between both plate electrodes amounts to 1.1 cm, and the wetted area in a well of the 12-well plate totals 0.42 cm2 when 1 mL ﬂuid is in the well (Figure 1b).

      "category:NarrativeText----> content:Abstract: An extensive research ﬁeld in regenerative medicine is electrical stimulation (ES) and its impact on tissue and cells. The mechanism of action of ES, particularly the role of electrical parameters like intensity, frequency, and duration of the electric ﬁeld, is not yet fully understood. Human MG-63 osteoblasts were electrically stimulated for 10 min with a commercially available multi-channel system (IonOptix). We generated alternating current (AC) electrical ﬁelds with a voltage of 1 or 5 V and frequencies of 7.9 or 20 Hz, respectively. To exclude liquid-mediated effects, we characterized the AC-stimulated culture medium. AC stimulation did not change the medium’s pH, temperature, and oxygen content. The H2O2 level was comparable with the unstimulated samples except at 5 V_7.9 Hz, where a signiﬁcant increase in H2O2 was found within the ﬁrst 30 min. Pulsed electrical stimulation was beneﬁcial for the process of attachment and initial adhesion of suspended osteoblasts. At the same time, the intracellular Ca2+ level was enhanced and highest for 20 Hz stimulated cells with 1 and 5 V, respectively. In addition, increased Ca2+ mobilization after an additional trigger (ATP) was detected at these parameters. New knowledge was provided on why electrical stimulation contributes to cell activation in bone tissue regeneration., Page_number: 1\n",

      "**Content** ===> The stimulation chamber C-Pace EM 100 is a multi-channel stimulator that enables the alternating current (AC)-stimulation of cells in an incubator. The electrodes are designed for a 12-well plate (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), and reach down to the bottom of the wells. This way, all cells can be electrically stimulated. The electrodes consist of carbon in the graphite modiﬁcation and are shaped in a plate format (capacitor). The advantages of graphite are its excellent electrical conductivity and the high resistance against corrosion. The protein adsorption on the surface is problematic as it affects the electrical ﬁeld´s homogeneity. Therefore, a regular cleaning after use is necessary [22]. The electrodes can be sterilized by treatment with ethanol and ultraviolet light (UV). The space between both plate electrodes amounts to 1.1 cm, and the wetted area in a well of the 12-well plate totals 0.42 cm2 when 1 mL ﬂuid is in the well (Figure 1b).

A widespread research ﬁeld in regenerative medicine is electrical stimulation (ES), and its impact on tissue and cells, such as bone [1]. In 1957 the piezoelectric properties of bone were described [2]. As the bone healing process takes place under the mechanical strain of the bone [3], an electric ﬁeld is generated in the bone in vitro and in vivo [4]. Externally applied electric ﬁelds were shown to contribute to bone deposition and osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [5]. The living cell has a membrane potential that indicates the electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space, which is generated by the transport of ions through ion channels and ion transporters [6]. The membrane potential is always negative because of the higher negative ion concentration inside the cell [7,8]. Primary osteoblasts revealed a membrane potential of −60 mV [9], MG- 63 osteoblasts demonstrated a negatively charged cell surface of −15.6 mV [10]. Due to the appearance of ions and polar or charged molecules, cells can build up electrical ﬁelds or can respond to them [11,12]. If injuries appear on the bone, a wound potential, which should lead precursor cells to differentiation, will be generated [13]. A possible approach for the  Cells 2022, 11, 2650. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11172650  https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells  therapy is through electrical stimulation to accelerate bone healing. In some publications, it is described that ES can manipulate different cell processes, for example, cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and differentiation [8,14]. Widespread methods of the ES for bone tissue are invasive methods like direct contact stimulation [14], in vitro, the electrically conductive electrodes are placed directly in the culture medium. The applied current streams from the anode to the cathode [15]. The modiﬁcation of the cell membrane potential through ES can activate different intracellular pathways. External electrical ﬁelds can generate an intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) ﬂow and consequently activate different pathways [16], such as wnt [17]. Ca2+ dynamics were identiﬁed as a sensitive parameter for cell physiological processes. Furthermore, the ES can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can control different cellular processes like proliferation and modulated signaling pathways [18,19]. When the equilibrium is destroyed, and the concentration of ROS is relatively high, cells suffer under oxidative stress. Moreover, Ca2+ signaling was shown to contribute to ROS generation through calmodulin [20], as well as ROS contributing to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations by altering calcium channels [21].  It was described that the electric ﬁeld could modulate cell functions in order to accelerate wound healing and bone regeneration [5,12,14]. In contrast to previous studies, we are focusing on the inﬂuence of a short alternating current (AC)-stimulation time on settling cells via a commercial device (IonOptix) with the following parameters: rectangular waveform, voltages of ±1 or ±5 V, frequency of 7.9 Hz with pulse duration of 10 ms, or 20 Hz with pulse duration of 3.6 ms. In vitro, cell processes such as intracellular Ca2+ level and mobilization, adhesion, and morphology of human osteoblasts within 24 h were studied to understand the effect of ES on osteoblast behavior. In addition, we wanted to shed light on the question of whether ES affects the cells via liquids, i.e., AC-pre-conditioned medium. For these cell experiments, solely the cell culture medium was stimulated in the IonOptix chamber and analyzed for pH, temperature, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide content.\n",

      "  2.1. Electrical Stimulation (ES) Chamber C-Pace EM 100  For electrical stimulation (ES), we used a multi-channel electrical stimulator, a voltage generator, and a 12-well C (culture)-Dish (IonOptix, Milton, MA, USA) (Figure 1a,c).  IonOptix devices were used for the electrical and mechanical in vitro stimulation of cells, e.g., stem cells, cardiogenic and osteoblasts, or for tissues [12,14].  The stimulation chamber C-Pace EM 100 is a multi-channel stimulator that enables the alternating current (AC)-stimulation of cells in an incubator. The electrodes are designed for a 12-well plate (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), and reach down to the bottom of the wells. This way, all cells can be electrically stimulated. The electrodes consist of carbon in the graphite modiﬁcation and are shaped in a plate format (capacitor). The advantages of graphite are its excellent electrical conductivity and the high resistance against corrosion. The protein adsorption on the surface is problematic as it affects the electrical ﬁeld´s homogeneity. Therefore, a regular cleaning after use is necessary [22]. The electrodes can be sterilized by treatment with ethanol and ultraviolet light (UV). The space between both plate electrodes amounts to 1.1 cm, and the wetted area in a well of the 12-well plate totals 0.42 cm2 when 1 mL ﬂuid is in the well (Figure 1b). To always establish identical conditions of the experiments, coverslips (Menzel™ Microscope Coverslips, Ø 18 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) were placed on each bottom of the 12-well plate.  ncubator P (37°C, 5% CO) _ Electrical stimulation 50 ms duration per period + = 1 1! 200 250 Time [ms] Ey Pulse duration: 3.6 ms 127 ms duration per period so 100 150 200 250 Time {ms} 4k Pulse duration: 10 ms 1V_7.9He SV_7.9He  Figure 1.

For the current measurement, each column of the 12-well plate (background) is connected to the IonOptix controller via a shunt resistor. The corresponding voltage drop is amplified by an instrumentation amplifier which can be connected to any of the columns (not shown). In (d) illustration of rectangular electronic bipolar pulses of the AC stimulation with 20 Hz, and (e) 7.9 Hz. The pulse duration covers both positive and negative half pulses.  This ES-chamber generates rectangular electronic biphasic pulses for electrical stim- ulation. The parameters can be varied: the applied voltage up to ±40 V, the frequencies from 0.01 to 99 Hz, and the pulse duration from 0.4 to 10 ms [12,14]. Every well is gated in a deﬁnite sequence.  In general, we used 1 and 5 V for the experiments, and a frequency of 20 Hz (3.6 ms double duration time, ± V) (1 V_20 Hz, 5 V_20 Hz) (Figure 1d) or 7.9 Hz (10 ms double duration time, ± V) (1 V_7.9 Hz, 5 V_7.9 Hz) (Figure 1e). After seeding, the cells in the 12-well plates were directly stimulated for 10 min. For the controls we worked with the C-Dish electrodes but without electrical stimulation (system still switched off) (Control).  2.2. Calculation and Simulation of ES  The applied electric ﬁeld strength was evaluated by employing numerical simulations. Under the assumption that the dielectric parameters of the cell culture medium are not frequency-dependent, the electrostatic Laplace equation is solved [23]. This equation reads  This yields the electric potential (φ). Subsequently, the electric ﬁeld can be computed by taking the gradient of the potential. As the solution depends linearly on the voltage difference between the two plates, we evaluated the electric ﬁeld at a voltage difference of 1 V. In the case of a different voltage difference, the solution can be linearly scaled. We used the ﬁnite element method for our computations, implemented in the open-source package EMStimTools (https://github.com/j-zimmermann/EMStimTools/releases/tag/ v0.1.4.dev0; accessed on 27 July 2022) [24]. The geometry of a single well was used and represented by a 2D model. The 2D representation corresponds to a slice through the geometry at a certain height and the top view, respectively.  2.3. Current Measurement  The electrodes of the 12-well plate are arranged in a 4 × 3 matrix such that individual wells can be addressed sequentially by applying the stimulation voltage to the respective row and column, see Figure 1c. Current measurement was accomplished via a shunt resistor (R = 1 Ω) inserted into each column, enabling the sequential measurement of all four wells in the same column. An instrumentation ampliﬁer with variable gain and high bandwidth (up to 500 kHz) was used to precisely convert the differential shunt voltage drop to a single-ended output voltage. The stated currents corresponded to the peak values of the time-dependent signal.  2.4. Characterization of AC-Stimulated Liquid  To eliminate the possibility that the electric ﬁeld inﬂuences the medium alone and thus inﬂuences the cell physiology, the medium parameters temperature, pH, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content were analyzed. For temperature, pH, and oxygen, fresh Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom FCS Superior, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and 1% gentamicin (Ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany) was exposed to ES for 10 min in a 12-well plate (1 mL per well). These parameters were measured in the middle of the liquid volume in the incubator at 37 ◦C, and 5% CO2 in triplicate: (i) temperature with the device Mini-K (Dostmann, with temperature gauger for Type K probes by testo), (ii) pH with a pH meter (Sentron SI series pH meter, SI400-010; Sentron Europe BV, Leek, The Netherlands), and (iii) oxygen with a needle-shaped optical oxygen microsensor (Oxygen micro-optode, type PSt1; Presens) connected to the Microx TX3 (Presens).  The H2O2 concentration was determined using the Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxidase Assay kit (Sigma Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). For H2O2 measurement, DMEM (without pyruvate; Life technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) with 10% FCS was 10 min AC-stimulated. H2O2 content was analyzed at time points 0, 0.5, 4, and 24 h, and the probes were kept at 37 ◦C.  For all Controls, the electrodes were placed in the medium, and the power switch was not returned on (no ES).  2.5. Cell Culture  The cell biological investigations were performed with human osteoblast-like cells MG-63 (passage number 5 to 30, ATCC® CRL-1427™, Manassas, VA, USA) [25]. The MG- 63s represent a well-established osteoblast model due to the similar characteristics in terms of cell spreading, adhesion, and signaling properties as primary human osteoblasts [25–27]. The MG-63s were cultivated in complete DMEM (with pyruvate, Thermo Fisher; 10% FCS; see Section 2.4.) at 37 ◦C in an incubator with 5% CO2. To obtain suspended cells for the experiments, cells were trypsinated (0.05% trypsin-EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Australia), collected in a complete medium and centrifuged (13,000× g, 4 ◦C, 5 min; Eppendorf 5702R; Hamburg, Germany).  2.6. AC-Activated Medium and Online Monitoring of Cell Adhesion  To solve the question of whether the electrostimulation effects on cells are mediated via the liquid, the medium alone was AC-activated. For long-time cell adhesion and spreading, the xCELLigence RTCA (Real-time Cell Analysis) S16 instrument (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) was used [28]. The impedance-based assay determines the ion environment at the microelectrode/solution interface. The system displays the impedance in an arbitrary unit—Cell Index, which is determined by the cell-microelectrode impedance minus the baseline-impedance (medium without cells).  The E-plate VIEW 16 (ACEA Biosciences, similar to 96-well format) was pre-incubated in an incubator at 37 ◦C for 2 h before the experiments started [29]. The complete DMEM was ﬁrst exposed to AC electric ﬁelds for 10 min. Then, MG-63s (10,000 cells/well) were seeded into the E-plate in 200 µL of the appropriate AC-stimulated medium. The impedance change caused by cell adhesion, and spreading was measured continuously at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 up to 24 h every 8 min. Data were analyzed using RTCA Data Analysis Software 1.0. The software calculated the slope of the cell adhesion over time, the Cell Index value after 24 h (Max Cell Index), and the adhesion rate (Cell Index at the time point when 50% of the cells adhere). MG-63s long-time adhesion was presented for ﬁve independent experiments.  2.7. AC stimulation of Cells and Initial Adhesion  The question arose whether cells in suspension are already activated by AC and thus their adhesion behavior is altered. To hold the cells (1 × 106) in suspension, MG-63s were shaken (ThermoMixer C; Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) in a complete medium at 300 rpm at 37 ◦C. For the initial adhesion approach, 40 µL of suspended MG-63s was seeded into one well (12-well plate) containing a coverslip, electrodes were placed, and ES was started. After 10 min, 300 µL of the non-adherent MG-63s in the supernatant were counted by the ﬂow cytometer FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) using CellQuest Pro 4.0.1 (BD) software for data acquisition. The number of adherent osteoblasts was calculated in percent relative to the cell number at 0 min (suspended cells without adhesion on glasses). A new seeding of MG-63s with different ES parameters was performed every 10 min within a series of approaches with the same cell vial. Initial adhesion assays were performed seven times in independent experiments.  2.8. Cell Morphology and Spreading  At 0.5, 4, and 24 h after electrical stimulation (ES), the medium was removed, and the cells on coverslips in the wells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 2.5% glutardialdehyde (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) solution in PBS. The samples were stored until further processing at 4 ◦C. The ﬁxed samples were washed with 0.1 M sodium–phosphate buffer (Merck KGaA), then they were dehydrated in an increasing ethanol solution and dried with the critical point dryer Emitech K850 (Quorum Technologies Ltd., East Sussex, UK) [29]. The dried samples were afﬁxed on sample holders with the aid of conducting carbon tape and  sputtered with a thin gold layer (10–15 nm; EM SCD 004, BAL-TEC, Balzers, Liechtenstein). The samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, MERLIN® VP Compact, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with the following instrumentation: HE-SE2 detector, acceleration voltage 5 kV, and working distance 5–7 mm.  TheFE-SEMimageswereprocessedwiththeprogramImageJ(NationalInstitutesofHealth, Bethesda, USA) to calculate the cell area. Therefore, 40 cells per treatment were measured.  2.9. Calcium Mobilization and AC stimulation  The membrane-permeable calcium indicator ﬂuo-3/AM (Life Technologies Corpora- tion, Eugene, OR, USA) was used [30], to detect if AC mobilizes calcium ions (Ca2+) in the cytosol. Fluo-3/AM consists of molecules with two free binding sites that display an increase in ﬂuorescence in the presence of free Ca2+.  MG-63s in a near conﬂuent state (70–80%) were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and centrifuged (Centrifuge 5810 R, Eppendorf AG). Next, 2 × 106 cells/2 mL were then resuspended in complete medium DMEM with shaking at 37 ◦C (ThermoMixer C). For every experiment, 2.5 × 105 cells from this pool were rewashed and centrifuged, and the cell sediment was stained with ﬂuo-3/AM (5 µM) in slightly hypotonic 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)- 1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer [31], with shaking at 37 ◦C. After 40 min, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 250 µL of isotonic HEPES (formulation described in [32]). Next, 750 µL of isotonic HEPES was added to a 12-well plate (glass bottom, Cellvis, Mountain View, CA, USA), the stained suspended cells were added, and stimulation was started immediately. After 10 min, AC stimulation was stopped, and electrodes were removed. Both, during stimulation and after the 10 min AC stimulation, time series visualized the calcium signal of MG-63s using an LSM780 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany, argon ion laser at 488 nm) with a C Apochromat 40× water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, 1.20 W Korr M27). The acquisition of the Ca2+ signal was made using Zen2011 (black edition, Carl Zeiss, Jenna, Germany). The ﬁrst time series during stimulation included 150 cycles every 2 s, whereby the Ca2+ signal was recorded upon stimulation after a 5 min settling phase of the cells. After the 10 min AC stimulation, the electrodes were removed, and the second time series was started with 240 cycles at 2 s intervals, whereby after the 90th cycle, 10 mM adenosine-50-triphosphate (ATP; SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany; dissolved in PBS) was added. The mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) analysis was evaluated with Zen2012 software (blue edition, version 2.0.0.0, Carl Zeiss). The mean ROI for 10 deﬁned areas of individual cells for each time point (240 cycles = 240 time points) was determined. In preliminary experiments, the cell areas went out of focus after approximately 60 s AC stimulation (not in Controls), so only the ﬁrst 30 cycles could be evaluated. At least 6 independent experiments were analyzed to see the inﬂuence of AC stimulation on calcium–ion dynamics (Figure 2). In all experiments, the Ca2+ signal was recorded under the same settings (gain, digital offset)  2.10. Cellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)  Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected via dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay (Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA) to verify whether the initial 10 min AC stimulation leads to oxidative stress. The non-ﬂuorescent substance DCFH- DA is incorporated by cells through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, the substance is deacetylated by esterases and cannot pass the cell membrane anymore. DCFH reacts with ROS like hydroxyl or peroxyl. Through the oxidation process 2, 7-dichloroﬂuorescein (DCF), which is highly ﬂuorescent, is generated [34].  of MG-63s 40 min Fluo-3/AM staining stimulation: ATP addition Electrodes Record basal Ca\" N level during AC a) After 90\" cycle qt = 5 mi 30 cyclesa2s ee @omn Record Ca settling cz) mobilization: phase of Kj, .@ 9 240cyclesa2s MG-63s Pas Start AC 4 Stop AC stimulation © stimulation & remove electrodes “x End of AC ™ stimulation AC stimulation 10 min  Figure 2. Scheme of experimental approaches of AC stimulation and calcium ions (Ca2+)-imaging in confocal microscopy. At ﬁrst, we stained the suspended MG-63s with ﬂuo3/AM for 40 min. Stained cells were then seeded into the 12-well plate under the microscope (LSM780, Carl Zeiss). Next, the electrodes were placed, and the electrical stimulation started. After a short settling phase of cells, a time series was done to measure the basal Ca2+ activity during ES (60 s). After 10 min ES, the electrodes were removed, and a second time series was recorded immediately to analyze the Ca2+ release and reaction after ATP addition (480 s; 240 cycles each 2 s, after 180 s ATP addition).

MG-63sweretrypsinized,centrifuged,andwashedwithPBS.Thecellpellet(1 × 106 cells) was resuspended in DCFH-DA staining solution (20 µM) and incubated using ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf; 300 rpm at 37 ◦C in the dark) for 30 min. Afterward, the stained MG-63s were washed, centrifuged, and resuspended in phenol-red free DMEM (without pyruvate, Life technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% FCS and gentamycin. 40 µL of stained cells were seeded on coverslips in the 12-well plates, electrodes were placed on them, and AC stimulation started, or not at Control samples. After ES, 5% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was pipetted in one Control sample as a positive check.  Immediately after stimulation, the DCF ﬂuorescence was recorded by the plate reader inﬁnite M200 (Tecan, Tecan i-control 1.9.17.0; Grödig, Austria) at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 535 nm. Subsequently, all samples were further cultivated in the incubator at 37 ◦C and removed at 0.5, 4, and 24 h for the ROS measurement. Four individual experi- ments with two respective technical replicates were done. The blank, i.e., the ﬂuorescence intensity of the phenol-red free medium, was subtracted from the sample values.  2.11. Statistics  All in vitro experiments were repeated at least three times (unless otherwise stated) with independently passaged cells. The GraphPad Prism 7 software for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to evaluate statistical differences in in vitro experiments. The data are illustrated in a boxplot showing the median, the minima, and the maxima (median ± min/max). In the ﬁrst step, we tested for normal distribution with the Shapiro–Wilk normality test (normal distribution: p > 0.05). Depending on the normal distribution, we used the parametric tests one-way ANOVA posthoc Bonferroni (paired values; medium characteristics, adhesion), one-way ANOVA posthoc uncorrected Fisher´s LSD (xCELLigence measurement, spreading, ROS production), or multiple t-tests (Ca2+ mobilization course).  For non-parametric procedures (no normal distribution), we applied the Friedman test (paired values) posthoc uncorrected Dunn’s test (Ca2+-level). We set the signiﬁcance limit of p < 0.05 [35].\n",

      "  3.1. Characterization of AC Electrical Stimulation (ES) Parameter  The electric ﬁeld strength and its magnitude between the electrodes can be seen in Figure 3. Between the electrodes, where the cells are placed, is a large region with a more or less homogeneous ﬁeld. Only close to the electrode edges a ﬁeld enhancement can be observed (Figure 3a). However, the area with an enhanced ﬁeld is small in comparison to the area with a more or less constant ﬁeld strength. Along the centerline of the well, the ﬁeld decreases from 91.7 V/m at the electrodes to 90.2 V/m precisely at the midpoint between the electrodes (Figure 3b). Under the assumption of inﬁnitely wide capacitor plates, the ﬁeld could also be analytically estimated. In this case, it would be equal to the voltage difference over the electrode spacing. At a voltage difference of 1 V and a spacing of 1.1 cm, this corresponds to 90.91 V/m. It is of great interest to validate the numerical model. Since neither the electric ﬁeld nor the electric potential in the well can be measured easily, the current through the electrode needs to be compared. The current equals the conductivity times the normal component of the electric ﬁeld integrated over the electrode surface, yielding 1.75 A/m for the 2D geometry. With a 1 mL cell culture medium, a ﬁll level of 3.4 mm is reached. It should be noted that capillary effects are not considered here. Then, the current is 5.95 mA for 1 S/m conductivity and scales linearly with the conductivity. Consequently, it would be 11.9 mA for 2 S/m and so on.  (a) 0.

Simulation data revealed (a) the electric ﬁeld distribution and strength (red arrows) between the two electrodes at a voltage difference of 1 V. The grey isolines highlight the regions where the ﬁeld reaches 80, 90, and 100 V/m (the latter in the vicinity of the electrodes’ sharp corners), respectively. Furthermore, (b) shows the electric ﬁeld strength along the centerline between the two electrodes. The result indicates that the cells are exerted to a mostly homogeneous ﬁeld with a magnitude of about 90 V/m. Note that for different voltage differences, the ﬁeld strength changes linearly w.r.t. the voltage.  The individual simulated and measured electric parameters are summarized in Table 1. The measured currents are peak values during the pulse. See Chapter 4 for a comparative discussion of these values.  8 of 22  Table 1. Individual ES values after measurement and simulation.

Acellular Medium Characteristics—AC-Stimulated Liquid  Analyzing the effect of AC stimulation on the culture medium is a crucial step in order to exclude changes in liquid properties, such as pH value, as a reason for the resulting cellular adaption/behavior.  The temperature of the AC-stimulated medium was signiﬁcantly changed vs. the Control only for the 5 V setups with 20 Hz and 7.9 Hz with 34.8 ± 0.3 ◦C and 34.6 ± 0.2 ◦C (mean ± s.e.m.), respectively. The mean value of the Control was 33.2 ± 0.3 ◦C (Figure 4a).  (a ny © 7 * w a r Temperature [°C] a 7.4 ee Se oo N Ly ZS N = | i ww Oxygen [%] = nN o = CJ S 9 S 9 yo eS  Figure 4.

(median ± min/max, n = 5–6, one-way ANOVA posthoc Bonferroni, * p < 0.05).  The pH values in the medium after ES did not change for 1 and 5 V in combination with 20 Hz and 7.9 Hz (e.g., Control pH 7.40 ± 0.03, 5 V_20 Hz pH 7.42 ± 0.02; mean ± s.e.m.) (Figure 4b).  The oxygen content in the medium was not changed after the 10 min AC stimulation (e.g., Control 20.2 ± 0.1%, 5 V_20 Hz 20.1 ± 0.09%; mean ± s.e.m.) (Figure 4c).  During electrical stimulation, faradic byproducts such as H2O2 can be generated. H2O2 in the media can inﬂuence cellular fate and may contribute to ES-induced effects. In our experiments, the concentration of H2O2 was only increased in media stimulated with 5 V_7.9 Hz compared to the Control (Figure 5). The mean concentration increased from 1.48 µM ± 0.02 in Control samples to 2.52 µM ± 0.32 in 5 V_7.9 Hz samples directly after 10 min ES. The H2O2 concentration declined over time in all samples, with 5 V_ 7.9 Hz showing elevated levels also after 0.5 h (mean 2.05 ± 0.28 µM). After 4 h and 24 h, the concentration was similar in all samples and leveled off at about 0.38 µM (Figure 5a,b). The overall decline was independent of the O2 concentration in the media (data not shown).

(Median ± min/max, n = 5–6, two-way ANOVA posthoc Bonferroni, * p < 0.05 compared to all).  3.3. AC-Stimulated Liquids and Long-Time Cell Adhesion  In order to analyze whether AC stimulation of liquids alone (rather than the cells) affected cell adhesion; we recorded the impedance with xCELLigence RTCA over 24 h. The adhering cells interfere with the electrode structures on the chip, thus impeding the electron response in the medium. The impedance depends on the number of cells, the cell size, and the strength of adhering cells. As shown in Figure 6, cells were not inﬂuenced by the AC- stimulated liquid, and the cell adhesion was approximately the same as the unstimulated Control. Solely a slight increase was detectable with 1 V_20 Hz AC-stimulated liquids  10 of 22  (Figure 6a). After 24 h, the max cell index (i.e., the 24 h endpoint value) in MG-63s was comparable in all liquids indicating no changes of the liquid DMEM due to AC stimulation (Control: 2.5 ± 0.1, 1 V_20 Hz: 2.7 ± 0.1, 1 V_7.9 Hz: 2.4 ± 0.1, 5 V_20 Hz: 2.5 ± 0.1, 5 V_7.9 Hz: 2.4 ± 0.1; mean ± s.e.m.; Figure 6b). In addition, the adhesion rate (time point when 50% of the cells adhere) was the same in all samples and showed no inﬂuence of the AC-stimulated liquid (Control, 1 V_20 Hz, 1 V_7.9 Hz, 5 V_7.9 Hz: all 0.5; 5 V_20 Hz: 0.4; mean; Figure 6c).

AC-Stimulated Cells  3.4.1. Initial Cell Adhesion  In the initial phase of a few minutes, the cellular adhesion of suspended cells starts with cell attachment of still rounded cells on the sample surface. In our approach, ﬂow cytometry was used to count the non-adhered cells, and then attached cells after 10 min AC stimulation were calculated in % of the adherent cells. In Figure 7, the inﬂuence of different electric ﬁeld parameters on initial cell adhesion is shown. It is clearly to be seen, that the cells were activated, and adhesion (in %) was accelerated under AC (1 V_20 Hz: 67.7 ± 5.9, 1 V_7.9 Hz: 67.8 ± 3.9, 5 V_20 Hz: 71 ± 4.3, 5 V_7.9 Hz: 61.9 ± 4.6, Control: 40.9 ± 5.7; mean ± s.e.m.) (Figure 7). Interestingly, the activation of cell adhesion is independent of the ﬁeld amplitude in the case of ES.  100 = 80 * * 2 8 60 ” = © 40 oO 3 20 < 0 r r r r r Ro ot a4 a4 ft & a? a ae ee N N % o  Figure 7.

Intracellular Calcium Ion (Ca2+) Level during AC stimulation  The intracellular Ca2+ signaling has been suggested to play a critical role in the impact of electric ﬁelds on cells. Therefore, we ﬁrst analyzed the immediate effect of AC stimulation on the Ca2+ level of ﬂuo-3-stained MG-63s. The mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI of Ca2+- signal) within 10 min AC stimulation of MG-63s is given in Figure 8. The AC electric ﬁeld activated the cells, and the level of calcium ions increased signiﬁcantly independent of the stimulation parameters used, but obviously with 20 Hz (1 V: 85.8 ± 0.2; 5 V: 90.1 ± 0.2; MFI mean ± s.e.m.) compared to the Control (78.5 ± 0.2; MFI mean ± s.e.m.).  100 95 90 85 80 75 70 MFI *” a? * a? a AW v7 > 7  Figure 8.

(LSM780, Carl Zeiss; time series of 30 cycles each 2 s started after 5 min settling phase of MG-63s; 7 independent experiments of deﬁned areas of 10 cells, i.e., 70 cells per time point; median ± min/max; Friedman test posthoc uncorrected Dunn’s test, * p < 0.05 compared to Control).  3.4.3. Calcium Ion Mobilization in AC-Pre-Stimulated Cells  It is obvious from Figure 8 that cells are activated during the 10 min AC stimulation. Figure 9 presents the time course of the intracellular Ca2+ signal of MG-63s immediately after ES. The basal intracellular Ca2+ ion level (time frame 0–179 s) is enhanced 1.2 times in cells that were pre-stimulated with the higher frequency of 20 Hz (Figure 9a). After an additional stimulus with the energy-rich molecule ATP at 180 s, the Ca2+ ions were mobilized signiﬁcantly in these cells with a strong slope and a plateau phase (Figure 9a). The Ca2+ level after ATP increased signiﬁcantly for AC pre-stimulated cells with the settings 5 V_20 Hz, 1 V_20 Hz, 5 V_7.9 Hz with MFI values of 164.9 ± 10.23, 178.2 ± 9.5,  and 162.5 ± 9.9, respectively; compared to Controls (MFI: 131 ± 9.1), and 1 V_7.9 Hz (MFI: 119.5 ± 8.9) (Figure 9b). These experiments were carried out in a calcium-containing medium. To solve the question of whether ES directly mobilizes the Ca2+ ions from internal stores during the period 0–179 s or if we observe an inﬂux of Ca2+ via the cell membrane, we used a calcium-free medium [36]. The additional experiments revealed that the basal Ca2+ level is also enhanced at least two times after ES (data not shown). Therefore, calcium ions are mobilized from intracellular stores.

The intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) signal of ﬂuo-3-loaded MG-63s after 10 min electrical stimulation. (a) The time course of the Ca2+ signal (0–480 s) was immediately started after the 10 min AC stimulation (0 s). The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) addition was at time point 180 s. Note that electrical stimulation with 20 Hz (1 and 5 V) and 5 V_7.9 Hz pre-activates the cells resulting in a signiﬁcantly increased mobilization of calcium ions after additional ATP.
